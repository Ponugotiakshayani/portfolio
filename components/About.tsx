        Graduated with a Master’s in Information Technology from Arizona State University, I’m a full-stack developer who thrives on building reliable, scalable software. I enjoy diving deep into backend systems, implementing clean APIs, integrating cloud infrastructure, and occasionally getting lost in AI models. What excites me most about coding is the challenge—whether it’s untangling a tricky bug or optimizing performance under the hood. My tech stack includes React, TypeScript, Next.js, Django, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and AWS. I’m always learning, iterating, and experimenting — not just to stay current, but to write better code that’s easier to maintain and scale. I’m actively looking for a full-time role where I can contribute to meaningful products and grow alongside a team that values curiosity, collaboration, and craft.
